# Venice-High-Water-prediction
Predicting water level in Venice trough metereological data from data scraping up to machine learning models. The code is presented in two Jupyter Notebooks, one for the data scraping and the other one for the analysis and the predictions. The code is also explained with my particular reasonings. A blog post for this project can be found [in my Blog](https://zanett96.github.io/2020/04/25/venice/).
